A simple game to learn and practice Java version features.

You can find a version of the game online at [https://mostlynerdless.de/java-game](https://mostlynerdless.de/java-game).

The source questions for the game are from the parent projects [test case files](../src/test/resources/feature_tests)
and the [alpha_features.json](./alpha_features.json) file.
