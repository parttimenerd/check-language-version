# Feature description rules for FeatureChecker.JavaFeature
# File format: single resource with blocks separated by headers.
# Each block documents one JavaFeature (enum name) and must follow the "Block Structure" below.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored by the loader.

# --------------------
# Block format overview
# --------------------
# - Header: a single line starting at column 0 with the feature name prefixed by '@'
#     Example: @AWT
# - The block contains labeled sections (exact labels, case-sensitive) in the order listed below.
# - No non-comment content is allowed before the first '@FEATURE' header.
# - Feature blocks need to be separated by multiple newlines
# - Be factual
# - add references for all claims
# - use inline code

# --------------------
# Block Structure (required sections, and exact labels)
# --------------------
# Each feature block MUST contain these sections in this order, split by a newline:
# 1) Summary: <one-line summary text>
#    - Single line immediately after the label. Max recommended length 160 chars.
# 2) Details:
#    - One or more Markdown paragraphs describing the feature, usage, and behavior.
#    - with code examples (if possible)
#    - mention and describe all newly introduced keywords (like sealed and non-sealed for SEALED_CLASSES)
# 3) Example:
#    - Exactly one fenced code block demonstrating the feature (use a language tag, e.g., ```java).
#    - The code block MUST include at least one inline comment (// or /* */) explaining the snippet.
# 4) Historical:
#    - Short paragraph explaining when/how it was introduced and important historical notes.
#      If none, write: Historical: N/A
#    - mention Java version it got introduced
#    - don't repeat yourself in Details and Historical
# 5) Links:
#    - A bullet list of labeled Markdown links (one per line). Each must be in form:
#        - [Label](https://example.com)
#    - Bare URLs (e.g., https://...) anywhere in the block are NOT allowed.
#    - For library/API features include at least one official/reference link (Oracle/OpenJDK/JEP/JSR, etc.).

# --------------------
# Link rules and validation
# --------------------
# - All links must be labeled Markdown links: use descriptive labels (e.g., [Oracle Javadoc], [JEP 408], [Wikipedia]).
# - Disallow bare urls: validator must fail if it finds an http(s) URL that is not the target of a Markdown link.
# - Recommended regexes for automated validation:
#     Header: ^@([A-Z0-9_]+)$
#     Labeled link: \[([^\]]{3,})\]\((https?://[^\s)]+)\)
#     Bare URL detection (fail if matches): (?<!\])https?://[^\s)]+
# - Example block detection: fence start ^```([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\s*$ and closing ``` on its own line.
# - Ensure example block contains at least one comment: look for '//' or '/*'.

# --------------------
# Historical
# --------------------
# - mention origin version, major milestones, deprecations or removals.
# - indicate whether the feature is commonly used today and why (short reason optional).

# --------------------
# Examples (templates)
# --------------------
@AWT
Summary: The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Java's original GUI toolkit.

Details:
AWT provides basic windowing and UI components in package `java.awt`. AWT components are thin wrappers
around native widgets on each platform which historically caused inconsistent look-and-feel and layout
behavior across platforms. Higher-level toolkits (Swing, JavaFX) were introduced later to provide richer,
consistent UI components.

Example:
```java
// Create a simple AWT Frame and show it (illustrative, not headless-safe)
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.Label;

public class AwtExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Frame f = new Frame("Hello AWT"); // AWT top-level window
        f.add(new Label("AWT example"));  // add a component
        f.setSize(300, 120);
        f.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

Historical:
Introduced in Java 1.0 as the first GUI toolkit for Java. Swing (since Java 1.2) built on top of/alongside
AWT and offered a more consistent cross-platform UI. AWT remains relevant for low-level native integration
and some legacy codebases.

@APPLET
Summary: The Applet API for embedding Java programs in web pages (obsolete).
Details:
The `java.applet` package allowed small Java programs (applets) to run inside browsers using the
`<applet>` tag and a plugin-based JVM. Applets ran in a security sandbox and could be signed for extra
privileges. Over time, plugin-based browser models and security concerns made applets impractical.

Example:
```java
// Legacy applet example (browsers no longer support applets)
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class HelloApplet extends Applet {
    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g) { // called by browser plugin
        g.drawString("Hello Applet", 10, 20); // renders text
    }
}
```

Historical:
Introduced early in Java's history to enable interactive web content. Applets declined in use after
security incidents and the removal of NPAPI plugin support in major browsers; the API is deprecated/removed
in modern Java distributions.

# Notes for generators and validators
# --------------------
# - A generator may produce initial Summary/Details/Example/Links content,
#   but the "Historical" field should be reviewed by a human to ensure accuracy.
# - Validators should:
#   * Assert header coverage: headers == EnumSet.allOf(JavaFeature.class)
#   * Assert required sections exist and are in order per block
#   * Fail on duplicate headers or empty example code blocks
#   * Fail if any bare URL is present or non at all (every features needs a link)
#   * Optionally check link reachability with a short timeout, store reachable links in file; make this optional for CI via a flag
# - Keep blocks small and focused: prefer short examples and 2-4 paragraph details.
