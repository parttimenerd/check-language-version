### Summary


Adds the `Socket` API for TCP network connections.

### Details

HotJava/Java 1.0-alpha2 introduced early networking primitives in the `net` package. The `Socket` class represents a client-side network connection to a remote host/port.

In modern Java this functionality exists in `java.net.Socket`, and it is used for building higher-level protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) on top of TCP.
