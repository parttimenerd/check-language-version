### Summary


Adds the [`java.io.IO`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/io/IO.html) convenience I/O API.

### Details

This feature represents usage of the `java.io.IO` convenience API, which provides a simplified surface for common I/O tasks.

It is related to the `IO_CLASS` feature, and it is primarily intended for the "small programs" enhancements introduced alongside compact source files.

### Example

```java
// Example intentionally omitted: this feature refers to java.io.IO, which exists only in newer Java versions.
class Example {}
```

### Historical

Introduced in Java 25; documented as preview in earlier releases.
