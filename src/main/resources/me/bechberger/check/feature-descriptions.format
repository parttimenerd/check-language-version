Feature description rules for FeatureChecker.JavaFeature

This repository stores feature descriptions as **one Markdown file per feature**.
Each file lives in:
  `src/main/resources/me/bechberger/check/features/`
and is named:
  `<FEATURE_ENUM_NAME>.md`

Example:
  `AWT.md` documents the `AWT` feature.

Lines starting with `#` in this `.mdmap` file are comments.

--------------------
Required structure (per feature .md file)
--------------------
Each feature file MUST contain the following sections in this order.
Each section header MUST be an H3 header (starts with `### `):

1) `### Summary`
   - One short paragraph (1–3 sentences) summarizing the feature.

2) `### Details`
   - One or more Markdown paragraphs describing the feature.
   - Be factual.
   - Use inline code for keywords and identifiers.
   - If the feature introduces new keywords (e.g., `sealed`, `non-sealed`), mention and explain them.

3) `### Example`
   - Exactly one fenced code block.
   - The fence MUST specify a language tag (typically `java`).
   - The code MUST contain at least one inline comment (`//` or `/* */`) explaining the snippet.

4) `### Historical`
   - A short paragraph describing when/how it was introduced and notable historical context.
   - Mention the Java version it was introduced in.
   - Do not repeat the Details section.
   - If unknown / not applicable, write a short sentence like `Historical: N/A`.

5) `### Links`
   - A bullet list of labeled Markdown links (one per line), each in the form:
       - [Label](https://example.com)
   - Every feature needs at least one link.

--------------------
Link rules and validation
--------------------
- All links MUST be labeled Markdown links.
- Bare URLs anywhere in the file are NOT allowed.
  Validator should fail if it finds an http(s) URL not used as a Markdown link target.
  Recommended bare URL detection regex (fail if it matches):
    (?<!\])https?://[^\s)]+

- “Mentions” of standard library packages, classes, and important methods should be links where reasonable.
  Examples:
    - Package mention: `java.util.regex` -> link to Oracle package summary.
    - Class mention: `Pattern` -> link to Oracle Javadoc.
    - Method mention: `Pattern.compile(String)` -> link to the specific Javadoc anchor.

- Some links may be validated for reachability (optional check).
  A committed whitelist exists for links that should be treated as valid even if not checked.

--------------------
Formatting rules
--------------------
- Do NOT include an "Introduced in: ..." line anywhere. (Use the Historical section instead.)
- Feature files may omit parts that are genuinely not applicable, but MUST keep the section headers.
- Keep blocks small and focused; prefer 2–4 short paragraphs in Details.
